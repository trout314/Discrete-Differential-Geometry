# Discrete-Differential-Geometry

Work in progress. Symbolic math package for discrete differential geometry computations. Some goals:

- [x] abstract simplicial complex type
- [x] combinatorial *n*-manifold type

* abstract simplicial complex type
* combinatorial *n*-manifold type
* Metropolis-Hastings sampling via Pachner moves and user-given objective
    * optimized implementations for special objective functions like total absolute angle-defect over hinges 
* vertex visibility determination in combinatorial manifolds
* pairwise discrete distance determination
